## Description

It is my pet project of user management system with ability to create users with avatars and view users with paginated list.
The project is specific for the practice of framework and library features.

Technologies used:

* Nest.js/Typescript
* OOP
* TypeORM
* PostgreSQL

Tested with Postman

What was done:
* Setup validation with custom errors based on Exception
* Handled multipart-form with POST request with file (just for practice, it is not REST)
* Cropped and optimized the avatar using the tinypng.com API.
* Implemented a data generator and seeders
* Added generation token with unvalidation after single request (for practi—Åe)
* Added endpoint for avatar output based on Node.js streams
* Created documentation with Swagger
